# PolygenceOfficialForumProject
With the help of Polygence, I participated in a research project and coded an application that allows users to create an account, post content, remove or edit content, request password resets, and much more!

# What is this project?
Hello! My name is Aaryan Srivastava, and this project is the result
of the research project I conducted with Polygence. This project is composed of multiple parts
which will be explained below, but there are also comments within the code itself
to help you understand it's purpose. Simply put, this project allows users to create an account
on a forum, customize their account, post/edit/delete content, reset passwords, and much more!

# My database
This application utilizes an SQLite database which is responsible for storing all the available users 
and the posts of this application. 

# My Python-Code
I coded this using Python, meaning to run this program, you will need to install
python and python flask.


# My HTML-code
This code also uses html and css to display the code on your local server. All of
my html files can be found in the templates folder. Each html file has comments
which explain what each file does.
My CSS code is located in static > css.

# How to run this using Anaconda (recommended)
Anaconda is essentially a python installation, however it additionally installs
other packages like Flask, things which normally would have to be manually installed.

Download Anaconda Individual Edition (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows).

Download my code using the download code button on the github page.

If the github download is not working, here is a backup google drive. However,
I recommend using github since it is more organized and easier to follow.
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1DtMg5OaBFjLh3tVaQ2Dpec7Zzjj7xMk8

Open the anaconda prompt on your Windows or Mac.

Similar to how you would change your directory on your cmd or mac cmd, navigate to
where the run.py file is in my folder. For example, you use the cd command to change the folder in cmd.

Once you navigate to the folder where the run.py file is, type in this command:
"python run.py". This should launch the program, and you should receive a URL that
begins with http:... Copy this and paste it in Chrome or your selected browser. Voila!
You can see my project! You can open these files in a text editor or a notepad and view the raw code as well.


# Reflection
This project was by far one of my most creative and interesting endeavors. I learned an unbelievable amount of coding especially 
in the world of Python and Flask. I learned new ways to organize my code (so rather than having one large file, I have various
linked files all achieving different purposes). I learned a lot more about databases and how to use them in projects. I learned 
about how to use encryptions to protect user passwords and therefore increase my project's cybersecurity. I learned how I can update
current database data with new data depending on what the user desires. I learned more about python flask's use of endpoints to navigate
through the page and also learned how to code an application to even send emails to recipients automatically. However, this project was
by no means an independent journey. With the help of my tutor, Mr. Pratik, on Polygence, I learned how to locate errors or bugs in my code
and how to approach coding one step at a time rather than continuously jump around trying to identify the error. I learned from various tutorials by Corey Schafer
and FreeCodeCamp (as well as many others) how to use python effectively and how to use creative CSS techniques to make my website more user-friendly.
This was an amazing experience and I have no regrets.
